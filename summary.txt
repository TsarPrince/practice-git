1. Majorly OS is for learning, gaining experience and helping others.
2. A kind and supportive behaviour must be maintained. No judgements!
3. We must thank and congratulate peoples wherever necessary.
4. Swearing / offensive languages must not be used.
5. Always read README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md before doing anything.
6. Fix one issue per PR.
7. Trying to cram multiple fixes into a single PR might make some people think you are trying to hide some malicious code in between the valid changes!
8. It is advisable to wait for even a few days for something like a PR reply. Be patient.

// EXTRAS
9. Only do the required changes mentioned in an issue, or atleast ask the mentor before adding anything extra.
10. Keep your main/master branch synced with main repo and send PRs from subsidiary branches only.
